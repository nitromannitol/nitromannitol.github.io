abstract: 'Random walks on graphs approximating Euclidean space are known to converge to Brownian motion. We introduce a family of graphs, orthogonal tiling graphs, flexible enough to approximate irregular manifolds, for which the trace of random walk converges to the trace of Brownian motion. This family includes Voronoi tessellations of Gaussian multiplicative chaos in arbitrary dimensions, and so our result implies a higher-dimensional generalization of <a href="https://www.intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/acta/content/vols/0228/0002/a002/index.php">Gwynne, Miller, and Sheffield (2022)</a>. Our proof proceeds by showing convergence of a finite volume scheme that induces a non-uniformly elliptic operator on the graph. One of our main contributions is an L<sup>2</sup>-L<sup>∞</sup> estimate for this operator. In the special case of 2D, our method also leads to a short proof of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001870820304072">Gurel-Gurevich, Jerison, and Nachmias (2020)</a>, which generalized earlier work by <a href="references/dubjeko1999.pdf">Dubejko (1999)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870811002143">Chelkak-Smirnov (2011)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870813000637">Skopenkov (2013)</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01209">Werness (2015)</a>. Orthogonal tiling graphs in 2D include isoradial graphs, which were used by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-011-0371-2">Chelkak and Smirnov (2012)</a> to establish the universality of critical Ising models. We believe orthogonal tiling graphs could help in studying this model and others in d > 2.',

abstract: 'A Brownian particle advected by an incompressible vector field undergoes enhanced diffusion. The extent of this enhancement depends on the correlation structure of the field. Above a critical correlation threshold, the particle is superdiffusive, with mean squared displacement scaling algebraically in time (t<sup>α</sup>, α > 1). Below the threshold, diffusion is enhanced, but the particle retains the usual diffusive scaling (α = 1). In this paper, we consider the critical case and show that under the superdiffusive scaling of (√log(t)·t), in the long-time limit, the particle converges, in a quenched sense, to ordinary Brownian motion. This problem has been considered heuristically by physicists <a href="references/sdphys1.pdf">since</a> <a href="references/sdphys2.pdf">at</a> <a href="references/sdphys3.pdf">least</a> <a href="references/sdphys4.pdf">1983</a>, where the (√log(t)·t) rate was predicted using heuristic renormalization group arguments. Our proof makes these renormalization group arguments rigorous using ideas from stochastic homogenization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first critical, infinite-scale, random model that has been shown to homogenize. We hope to apply these ideas to other critical models with an infinite number of length scales. See this <a href="https://www.scottnarmstrong.com/2024/04/superdiffusive-clt/">blog post</a> for a more detailed summary.',

    abstract: 'Bounded harmonic functions are constant. However, there are non-constant harmonic functions on R<sup>d</sup> that are bounded on all but a tiny fraction of space (see, <a href="references/polya.pdf">[8, Ch 3, Problems 158-160]</a>). These functions have no immediate discrete analogue, and it turns out cannot exist on periodic planar graphs. We prove that for any periodic planar graph G, there exists a constant &alpha;(G) such that any discrete harmonic function which is bounded on a (1 - &alpha;(G))-density of the graph is constant. A key aspect of the argument is a new unique continuation result for periodic planar graphs. Our proof is based on the maximum principle and elementary geometric arguments. It generalizes and simplifies earlier work by <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/duke-mathematical-journal/volume-171/issue-6/A-discrete-harmonic-function-bounded-on-a-large-portion-of/10.1215/00127094-2021-0037.short">Lev Buhovsky, Alexander Logunov, Eugenia Malinnikova, and Mikhail Sodin</a>, who established this result on the square lattice using techniques specific to that setting.

We are currently exploring the implications of our new proof technique to Anderson localization.',

abstract: 'H. A. Heilbronn <a href="references/heilbronn.pdf">showed</a> in 1949 that the dimension of the space of discrete harmonic polynomials on Z<sup>d</sup> coincides with that of R<sup>d</sup>. This theorem holds for any periodic lattice and was recently extended by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09431">Scott Armstrong and Paul Dario</a> to the supercritical percolation cluster, where their proof used the fact that, on large scales, the cluster resembles R<sup>d</sup>. However, in models such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0449?context=math">Ising model</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4809">Abelian sandpile</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04284">Anderson localization</a>, small-scale changes in the graph induce qualitatively distinct global behavior. Motivated by this, we prove three theorems on the supercritical cluster that do not hold on Z<sup>d</sup>. Using quantitative homogenization, we show the absence of Lipschitz harmonic functions, the absence of integer-valued harmonic functions with polynomial growth, and, in dimension 2, the absence of functions with integer-valued graph Laplacians decaying faster than 1/|x| at infinity. We expect these results and our techniques will help in understanding other models on the cluster. (The final section includes many conjectures and partial results regarding the Abelian sandpile on the cluster.)',

abstract: 'The scaling limit of the Abelian sandpile is a fully nonlinear elliptic PDE with a delicate lattice dependence. This dependence is expressed through the quadratic growths of integer-valued, lattice-superharmonic functions (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00411">Section 6 of this survey</a> for an exposition). <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2017/186-1/p01">Lionel Levine, Wesley Pegden, and Charles Smart showed</a> that these functions on Z<sup>2</sup> are characterized by an Apollonian packing of the plane. While their proof was specific to Z<sup>2</sup>, with some effort it can likely be adapted to the triangular, hexagonal, and trihexagonal lattices, where the Apollonian packing is replaced by other circle packings (see these <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~wes/sandgallery.html">simulations by Pegden</a>). However, the F-lattice presents a distinct situation. In this paper, I show that the set of integer superharmonic functions on the F-lattice is governed by a recursion involving rational points on a hyperbola. I conjecture that the objects describing the scaling limits of the Abelian sandpile on general, periodic graphs are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13838">Kleinian bugs</a>.'
